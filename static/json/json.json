        "description":"Unsettling Signs: Indexical Disorder and the Diacritics of Raciolinguistic Life\r\n\r\nThe framework of indexical order has been powerfully deployed in sociolinguistic and broader semiotic analyses throughout the world. This presentation critically engages with prevailing empiricist approaches to indexicality which focus on signs\u2019 heterogeneous meanings across contexts. It examines institutionalized attributions of deficiency and experiences of structural marginalization to offer the alternative framework of indexical disorder, which emphasizes the profound role of modern colonialism and racism in overdetermining signs\u2019 meaningfulness. The goal is to develop new insights into organizing power structures across contexts, as well as to rethink how indexicality can be a crucial analytic for understanding and unsettling these structures.  \r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan Rosa is Associate Professor of Education, Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies, and, by courtesy, Anthropology, Linguistics, and Comparative Literature at Stanford University. He is author of Looking like a Language, Sounding like a Race: Raciolinguistic Ideologies and the Learning of Latinidad (2019, Oxford University Press) and co-editor of Language and Social Justice in Practice (2019, Routledge). His work has been published in scholarly journals such as Harvard Educational Review, American Anthropologist, American Ethnologist, and Journal of Linguistic Anthropology, as well as featured in media outlets including The New York Times, The Nation, NPR, and Univision.",

Zoom registration at https:\/\/myumi.ch\/MrNjW\r\n\r\nMengzi claims that human beings have natural affective responses that lead them toward being good, but virtue requires extending and modifying these feeling so that they arise in all of the appropriate circumstances. In this talk, I argue that, for Mengzi, the cultivation of emotions is based not on judgment or analogy but on perception. The goal of cultivation is to shape oneself so that the world appears in a certain way.\r\n   \r\nFranklin Perkins is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Hawai\u2019i at M\u0101noa and editor of the journal Philosophy East and West. His main research interests are in classical Chinese philosophy, early modern European philosophy, and in the challenges of doing philosophy in a comparative or intercultural context. He is the author of \"Heaven and Earth are not Humane: The Problem of Evil in Classical Chinese Philosophy\" (Indiana, 2014), \"Leibniz: A Guide for the Perplexed\" (Bloomsbury, 2007), and \"Leibniz and China: A Commerce of Light\" (Cambridge, 2004), and was co-editor of \"Chinese Metaphysics and Its Problems\" (Cambridge, 2015), with Chenyang Li. His most recent book is \"Doing What You Really Want: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Mengzi\" (Oxford University Press, 2021).\r\n   \r\nIf there is anything we can do to make this event accessible to you, please contact us. Please be aware that advance notice is necessary as some accommodations may require more time for the university to arrange.",

Zoom registration at https:\/\/myumi.ch\/pkDjq\r\n\r\nWith a history spanning just over 100 years, Korean art song (Gagok), is an equally sophisticated and beautiful genre as German Lieder or French m\u00e9lodies. The repertoire has received almost no attention by performers and scholars, however. The majority of those who do study and perform it tend to be of Korean background and already have mastery of the language.\r\n   \r\n   Since 2020, Dr. Matthew Thompson has run a FEAST research team at U-M dedicated to making Korean art song more accessible to English speakers. What are the challenges of encountering this repertoire as a non-native speaker? What materials and resources exist to aid those interested in further study? Dr. Thompson will present both on his research and on the materials that he is developing to help more people engage with this amazing repertoire.\r\n\r\nIf there is anything we can do to make this event accessible to you, please contact us. Please be aware that advance notice is necessary as some accommodations may require more time for the university to arrange.",

        "description":"Piracy in the Horn of Africa and Arabian seaboards has been a major dynamic of modern geopolitics of the Western Indian Ocean (and very dramatically so in recent months), and the phenomenon of maritime predation is certainly not new in the region.  Moreover, the notion of thieves of the high seas is visible in medieval Arabic sources.  As in other world contexts, the very definition of the terms \u201cpiracy\u201d and \u201cnaval predation\u201d is of the essence.  For the period between the 7th  and the 16th  century, the maritime and naval capability of large and small polities active in the Red Sea area has been the subject of recent scholarship that is contributing new data and concepts, enhancing our understanding of regional and trans-regional economic networks and the development of premodern states. This inquiry also illuminates long-term structures, such as the role of islands and maritime geography in general, that can illuminate more recent events through comparison and contrast. This presentation will outline relevant sources and concepts and comment on the recent historiography.\r\n   \r\nRoxani Eleni Margariti is an associate professor at the Department of Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies at Emory University. She is the author of *Aden and the Indian Ocean Trade: 150 Years in the Life of a Medieval Arabian Port* (University of North Carolina Press, 2007) and is currently completing a book manuscript entitled *Insular Crossroads: The Dahlak Archipelago, Red Sea Islands, and Indian Ocean History*, in which she examines the history of a Muslim, island polity in medieval and early modern times. She also co-authors an academic blog Archives of the Sea.\r\n\r\nRegister to the event: http:\/\/bit.ly\/48BQxpS",

        "description":"When the AI chatbot ChatGPT went public just over a year ago, interest in generative artificial intelligence exploded. Enthusiasts touted AI's ability to turn anyone into a writer or an artist, to make workers more efficient and companies richer\u2014that is, if it didn't become powerful enough to destroy humanity altogether. Skeptics pointed out that AI language models spout falsehoods and facts with equal confidence, can churn out disinformation too quickly for fact-checkers to keep up, and threaten writers' jobs and livelihoods.\r\n \r\nIn science communication, where accuracy and understanding are priorities, is there any place for AI tools? Sophie Bushwick has been covering this technology through the generative AI boom, exploring how artificial intelligence models work and how they're impacting a variety of fields, including medicine and education. She will draw on that experience to discuss AI's strengths and flaws, and what scientists and science communicators should consider when deciding how best to use it. \r\n\r\n*The LSI's SciComm Speaker Series highlights the importance of disseminating scientific findings beyond the walls of the academy and effectively communicating the impact of publicly-funded research. This annual event provides world-leading science writers and communicators with an opportunity to share their experiences with faculty, staff and students, while also tapping into U-M's vast scientific research community.*\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker:\r\nSophie Bushwick is a science and technology journalist based in New York City and is currently working as senior news editor at New Scientist. She has more than a decade of experience as a freelance writer and staff editor at outlets including Scientific American, where she covered the recent generative AI boom, Popular Science, Discover Magazine and Gizmodo; and she continues to make regular appearances on Science Friday. Her work spans digital and print, podcasts and radio, TV news and TikTok. In her spare time, she likes to read, run, learn about the evolution of fairy tales and take in as much theater as possible.",

        "description":"MPSDS JPSM Seminar Series\r\nApril 3, 2024\r\n12:00-1:00 pm\r\n\r\nIn person, Room 1070 Institute for Social Research, and via Zoom. The Zoom call will be locked 10 minutes after the start of the presentation. \r\n\r\nTexting in Mixed-Mode Studies: Results from Recent Research Experimentation \r\n\r\nUsing multiple modes of contact has been found to increase participation in surveys over a single contact mode. Text messaging has emerged as a new mode to contact survey participants in mixed-mode survey designs, especially for surveys that include web and\/or phone data collection. However, it has been unclear how to best combine text messages with mailings and other outreach contacts to improve response rates and data quality. At NORC, we launched a program to explore the effectiveness of using text messaging as a contact mode and embedded experiments in multiple NORC studies to better understand the impact and benefits of texting. In this seminar, we highlight results from our recent experimental research, including the effectiveness of text invitations and text reminders at different points in the contact sequence, the time-of-day text messages are sent, and whether text reminders are more effective than postcard reminders. Objectives for this seminar include: to understand how texting is used for contacting potential survey respondents at NORC, share examples from texting on specific NORC projects, and discuss results from recent studies on how best to use texting.\r\n\r\nLeah Christian is Senior Vice President directing the Methodological and Quantitative Social Sciences department. Prior to joining NORC, Christian worked at Nielsen and the Pew Research Center. Christian brings over 20 years of experience in survey methodology and panel research, including work with federal, academic, commercial, and nonprofit organizations. She is an expert in data collection modes, mixed-mode survey and panel designs, and questionnaire design and measurement error. Her research also focuses on evaluating big data for use in social science research, integrating survey and big data, and using survey data to correct for errors in big data. Christian is co-author of Internet, Phone, Mail, and Mixed-Mode Surveys: The Tailored Design Method and has published 15 articles on research methodology in a variety of journals and presented more than 50 conference, webinar and short courses on research methodology and data science. Christian was a recipient of AAPOR\u2019s Warren J. Mitofsky\u2019s Innovators Award in 2017 for her work with a research team developing web-push data collection methodologies. Christian holds a PhD in sociology from Washington State University. \r\n\r\nChristopher Hansen is a Research Methodologist with over 10 years of experience in applied research. During his time at NORC, he has worked in the capacity of methodologist on numerous projects in the areas of survey and questionnaire design and cognitive and usability testing. These projects include the National Domestic Workers Alliance (NDWA) Labs Methodology Review, the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods with Harvard University, the CDC\u2019s Survey of Today\u2019s Adolescent Relationships and Transitions, and the CDC\u2019s COVID Experiences Longitudinal Surveys. Hansen teaches courses in research methodology at Loyola University Chicago and DePaul University and has presented on topics related to survey design and measurement at national conferences, including the American Association for Public Opinion Research and the American Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. Hansen holds a master\u2019s degree in sociology from the University of Chicago.  \r\n\r\nMartha McRoy is a Senior Research Methodologist who specializes in survey sample design, questionnaire development, fieldwork monitoring and implementation, quality control, and data weighting for web, mail, telephone, face-to-face, and mixed-mode surveys. McRoy provides rigor in all stages of survey research with project work covering a breadth of topics including public opinion, religion, health, justice, and transportation. Her experimental work focuses on mode shifts and bridge studies, predicting response propensities and survey outcome dispositions of sampled respondents, increasing response rates for hard-to-reach populations, and developing tools to monitor data collection activity. McRoy brings over ten years of experience in survey statistics and methodology, including working at Abt Associates, Westat, the Pew Research Center, and the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. She holds a master\u2019s degree in survey methodology from the University of Michigan.\r\n\r\nZoe Slowinski is a Research Methodologist with over 12 years of applied research experience in the U.S. and internationally, including work with federal, academic, and nonprofit organizations. Her work focuses on survey design, measurement error, and qualitative data collection. At NORC, she develops questionnaires, conducts cognitive and usability interviews, plans and moderates focus groups, and analyzes data for clients such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, National Science Foundation, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Slowinski's experimental work focuses on the use of texting and email as survey contact modes. She holds a master\u2019s degree in public policy from George Mason University.",

However, I will argue that there is compelling evidence that some version of it should be true in quantum gravity. Working towards a quantum gravitational formulation of the WCCC, I will prove \u201cCryptographic Censorship\u201d, a theorem that provides a general condition for the formation of event horizons in AdS\/CFT: sufficiently (pseudo)random boundary dynamics. I will also provide a classification of sizes of singularities, and show that \u201clarge\u201d, \u201cclassical\u201d singularities \u2013 the ones that the WCCC should rule out \u2013 are compatible with sufficiently (pseudo)random dynamics. Thus, if such singularities are indeed described by (pseudo)random dynamics, then they cannot exist in the absence of event horizons.",

        "description":"Abstract: \r\nThe National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is the world\u2019s most energetic laser now capable of providing 2.2 MJ of laser light at 351 nm to the target chamber.  The primary goal of NIF is to demonstrate fusion ignition (and then as high-as-possible yield), an un-precedented proof-of-principle.  On August 8, 2021, fusion ignition was demonstrated at NIF according to several ignition metrics.  This was achieved using the indirectly driven laser fusion concept, where laser light is converted to x-rays upon striking the interior of a high-Z cavity, creating a radiation oven for a capsule comprised of heavy hydrogen fuel (which when driven to appropriate conditions undergoes fusion) surrounded by an ablator.  The experiment, N210808, burned about 2% of the fuel, using 1.9 MJ of laser energy and producing 1.37 MJ of fusion yield.  Repeat experiments showed variability to unintentional degradations such as capsule quality and low mode asymmetries, and so, to enhance robustness, a larger capsule was fielded, using 7% more laser energy, i.e., 2.05 MJ.  This experiment (N221204), and its repeat (N230729), achieved 3.15 and 3.88 MJ of fusion yield, or a target gain of 1.5 -1.9, burning up to 5% of the fuel.\r\n     This presentation reviews background material and guiding principles, as well as important lessons learned.  Additionally, the challenges that lie ahead of the national inertial confinement fusion program will be outlined.\r\n\r\nAbout the Speaker: \r\nDr. Denise Hinkel is a physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Lab and serves as Modeling Lead for the Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) Program as well as Associate Division Leader for ICF and High Energy Density Physics (HED) in the Design Physics Division.  She is also technical coordinator of a special program.  Denise\u2019s expertise spans theoretical analyses to massively parallel computing, basic plasma physics to reduced model descriptions and design and analysis of laser-based experiments using radiation-hydrodynamics simulations.  She applied her design expertise to a series of NIF shots known as the \u201cHigh Foot\u201d, where for the first time the energy released in fusion reactions exceeded the energy used to compress the fuel.  Denise has served as the point-of-contact for Laboratory Directed Research and Development, managing the portfolio and developing strategic plans with her directorate and institution.  Denise received the MS and PhD in Physics from UCLA and became Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS) in 2007.  In 2022, she served as Chair of the APS Division of Plasma Physics. She has received multiple awards, has provided physics outreach to students of all ages, and has served on many review committees.\r\n\r\nThis is a hybrid event.

        "description":"Abstract:\r\n\r\nThe last several years have brought notable successes in the application of machine learning approaches, and especially deep learning models, to problems in single-cell and regulatory genomics.  The advent of single-cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) and multiome (scRNA+ATAC-seq) brings new machine learning challenges and opportunities to link chromatin state to developmental trajectories, gene regulation, and even higher order chromatin organization. We will present recent models from our group to exploit these new single-cell data modalities: CellSpace, a sequence-informed embedding algorithm for scATAC-seq that learns biologically meaningful latent structure while mitigating batch effects; SCARlink, a gene-level regression model for multiome data that identifies cell-type-specific enhancers and enables interpretation of disease-associated genetic variants; and ChromaFold, a deep learning model that predicts the 3D contact map from scATAC-seq alone.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/umich-health.zoom.us\/j\/93929606089?pwd=SHh6R1FOQm8xMThRemdxTEFMWWpVdz09",

        "description":"Elena Kostyuchenko will present her new book, *I Love Russia: Reporting from a Lost Country.* Her book is a collection of reportage and personal essays from the past 15 years. To be a journalist is to tell the truth. *I Love Russia* is Kostyuchenko's unrelenting attempt to document her country as experienced by those whom it systematically and brutally erases: village girls recruited into sex work, queer people in the outer provinces, patients and doctors at a Ukrainian maternity ward, and reporters like herself.\r\n\r\nKostyuchenko is a Russian independent journalist. She was a special correspondent for *Novaya Gazeta *for 17 years until the newspaper shut down in March 2022 due to pressure from the Russian government. She reports on armed conflicts, crime, human rights, and social issues and was among the first journalists to document the presence of Russian troops in Eastern Ukraine, covering the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine since its second day. Currently, she collaborates with the exiled independent Russian media network Meduza. Kostyuchenko has received multiple journalism awards, including the European Press Prize, the Gerd Bucerius Prize Free Press of Eastern Europe, and the Paul Klebnikov Prize.\r\n\r\nKostyuchenko will be joined in conversation by Professor Elizabeth King, CREES Director. \r\n\r\nA book signing will follow the lecture, with Kostyuchenko's book available for purchase from Literati.\r\n\r\nCo-sponsors: Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures,  Institute for Research on Women and Gender\r\n\r\nIf there is anything we can do to make this event accessible to you, please contact crees@umich.edu. Please be aware that advance notice is necessary as some accommodations may require more time for the university to arrange.",

His publications include *From Cultures of War to Cultures of Peace: War and Peace Museums in Japan, China, and South Korea* (Merwin Asia, 2014) and *The Making of the \u201cRape of Nanking\u201d: History and Memory in Japan, China, and the United States* (Oxford University Press, 2006).\r\n   \r\n   *This lecture is made possible with the generous support of the U.S. Department of Education Title VI grant.*\r\n\r\nIf there is anything we can do to make this event accessible to you, please contact us at wugou@umich.edu.

        "description":"Educator staffing shortages have drawn considerable attention from policymakers and the public in recent years. While much attention is directed towards K-12 teachers, there is growing concern about shortages of substitute teachers because of the negative impact on teachers and administrators when schools regularly have insufficient staff to cover teacher absences and vacancies (Diliberti & Schwartz, 2023; Zuo et al., 2023). Despite this problem, few studies assess the state of the substitute teacher labor market or how substitutes experience the job in ways that affect their willingness to work. This talk presents results from a mixed method study on Michigan\u2019s substitute teacher labor market, focusing on: 1) state-level trends in the Michigan substitute teacher labor market from 2018-2021, 2) survey results on career decisions and perceptions of working conditions from a simple random sample of 525 substitute teachers, and 3) follow-up interviews with a purposive sample of substitute teachers on their experiences of working conditions and how they made decisions about whether and where to work.",

Second, two developments from the Virginia Image and Video Analysis laboratory will be described. A diffusion method for multiplicative noise will be outlined. And, a special-purpose transformer for recognizing human activity from videos will be explained. The talk will conclude with recommendations regarding research in artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nBio:\r\nScott T. Acton is the Lawrence R.

Thanks to its high sensitivity and resolution, Webb is a major step \r\nforward in studying the physical and chemical structure of embedded protostars and disks. This talk will present an overview of recent results from a number of JWST programs on gaseous and icy molecules, from water to a variety of organic species. Together with related ALMA data, they point to a rich chemistry with a varying composition and C\/O ratio that may be linked to stellar mass and to the physical structure of the planet-forming zones of disks.",

        "description":"This lecture uses the concept of promissory talk to critically analyze one way of thinking \u201cagainst history.\u201d Promissory talk is a future-oriented version of counterfactual speculation. Rather than asking \u201cwhat if\u2026?\u201d questions of historical events when the outcomes are already known, promissory speech says \u201cif only\u2026 then\u2026\u201d as a way of linking present policy actions to anticipated future results. Drawing on examples from Japan and the United States, Professor Thomas will show how recent efforts to reframe children\u2019s historical consciousness reflect a dubious promissory premise: \u201cIf only the kids had more national pride, then all of our problems would be solved.\"\r\n\r\nJolyon Baraka Thomas is associate professor of religious studies at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the author of Faking Liberties: Religious Freedom in American-Occupied Japan (University of Chicago Press, 2019) and Drawing on Tradition: Manga, Anime, and Religion in Contemporary Japan (University of Hawaii Press, 2012). Thomas\u2019s current research projects include the monograph Difficult Subjects: Religion and the Politics of Public Education under the US-Japan Security Alliance, a co-authored book called Animating Action, and the co-edited New Nanzan Guide to Japanese Religions.\r\n\r\nThis event presented by the Eisenberg Institute for Historical Studies. It is made possible in part by a generous contribution from Kenneth and Frances Aftel Eisenberg.",

        "description":"Register to attend on Zoom: https:\/\/myumi.ch\/ZDZMj \r\n\r\nThe DISCO Network is a collaborative, intergenerational research group of scholars dedicated to analyzing digital technology, race, disability, sexuality, and gender. The network comprises of six laboratories across five universities (University of Michigan, Northwestern University, The University of Maryland-College Park, Stony Brook University, Georgia Institute of Technology), each of which stands alone and a network node to write, talk, and think about the past, present, and future of technology, Blackness, Asianness, disability, and liberation. The DISCO Network is supported by the Mellon Foundation. \r\n\r\nThis panel will be a conversation with the Principal Investigators (PIs) of the DISCO Network, Andr\u00e9 Brock, Catherine Knight Steele, Lisa Nakamura, Rayvon Fouch\u00e9, Remi Yergeau, and Stephanie Dinkins. What can an equitable digital future look like? In our contemporary moment, is it possible to create transformative movements, rooted within humanistic inquiry, to address inequities, histories of exclusion, disability injustice, techno-ableism, and digital racial politics? Over the past few years, the DISCO Network began a portion of this work. The collective will reflect on its collaborative effort and explore the tensions between digital optimism and technoskepticism.\r\n\r\nPanelists:\r\n\r\nAndr\u00e9 Brock (he\/him) is an Associate Professor of Media Studies at Georgia Tech. He writes on Western technoculture, Black technoculture, and digital media. His scholarship examines Black and white representations in social media, video games, weblogs, and other digital media. He has also published influential research on digital research methods. His first book, titled Distributed Blackness: African American Cybercultures, was published with NYU Press in 2020 and theorizes Black everyday lives mediated by networked technologies.\r\n\r\nCatherine Knight Steele (she\/her) is an Associate Professor of Communication at the University of Maryland - College Park where she serves as the Director of the Black Communication and Technology Lab. Her research focus is race, gender and media with specific focus on Black culture and discourse and digital communication. She examines representations of marginalized communities in the media and how groups resist oppression and utilize online technology to create spaces of community. Her book Digital Black Feminism (NYU, 2021), examines the relationship between Black women and technology as a centuries-long gendered and raced project in the U.S. Using the virtual beauty shop as a metaphor, Digital Black Feminism walks readers through the technical skill, communicative expertise, and entrepreneurial acumen of Black women\u2019s labor\u2014born of survival strategies and economic necessity\u2014both on and offline.\r\n\r\nLisa Nakamura (she\/her) is the Gwendolyn Calvert Baker Collegiate Professor in the Department of American Culture, and the founding Director of the Digital Studies Institute, at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Since 1994, Nakamura has written books and articles on digital bodies, race, and gender in online environments, on toxicity in video game culture, and the many reasons that Internet research needs ethnic and gender studies. These books include, Race After the Internet (co-edited with Peter Chow-White, Routledge, 2011); Digitizing Race: Visual Cultures of the Internet (Minnesota, 2007); Cybertypes: Race, Ethnicity, and Identity on the Internet (Routledge, 2002); and Race in Cyberspace (co-edited with Beth Kolko and Gil Rodman, Routledge, 2000). In November 2019, Nakamura gave a TED NYC talk about her research called \u201cThe Internet is a Trash Fire. Here\u2019s How to Fix It.\u201d\r\n\r\nRayvon Fouch\u00e9 (he\/him) is a Professor of Communication Studies at the Medill School of Journalism, Media, and Integrative Marketing Communications at Northwestern University. His scholarship on invention and innovation explores the multiple intersections and relationships between cultural representation, racial identification, and technoscientific design. He has authored or edited Black Inventors in the Age of Segregation (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003), Appropriating Technology: Vernacular Science and Social Power (Minnesota, 2004), Technology Studies (Sage Publications, 2008), the 4th Edition of the Handbook of Science & Technology Studies (MIT Press, 2016), and Game Changer: The Technoscientific Revolution in Sports (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2017).\r\n\r\nRemi Yergeau (they\/them) is Associate Professor of Digital Studies and English, and Associate Director of the Digital Studies Institute, at the University of Michigan. Their book, Authoring Autism: On Rhetoric and Neurological Queerness, was awarded the 2017 MLA First Book Prize, the 2019 CCCC Lavender Rhetorics Book Award for Excellence in Queer Scholarship, and the 2019 Rhetoric Society of America Book Award. They are currently at work on a second book project about disability, digital rhetoric, surveillance, and (a)sociality, tentatively titled Crip Data. Active in the neurodiversity movement, they have previously served on the boards of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) and the Autism National Committee (AutCom).\r\n\r\nStephanie Dinkins (she\/they) is a transmedia artist who creates platforms for dialog about race, gender, aging, and our future histories. Dinkins\u2019 art practice employs emerging technologies, documentary practices, and social collaboration toward equity and community sovereignty. She is particularly driven to work with communities of color to co-create more equitable, values grounded social and technological ecosystems. Dinkins exhibits and publicly advocates for equitable AI internationally. Her work has been generously supported by fellowships, grants, and residencies from United States Artist, The Knight Foundation, Berggruen Institute, Onassis Foundation, Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI, Creative Capital, Sundance New Frontiers Story Lab, Eyebeam, Data & Society, Pioneer Works, NEW INC, and The Laundromat Project. Dinkins is a professor at Stony Brook University where she holds the Kusama Endowed Professorship in Art.",

        "description":"Shantell Martin\u2019s work has entranced audiences around the world in its intuitive energy, skill and bravura. With her highly personalized language of characters, faces, creatures, and messages, Martin invites viewers to actively engage in the creative process. Using drawing as a physical stream-of-consciousness, her work is characterized by a unique freedom, expressed through the possibilities of her chosen \u2018canvas\u2019 \u2013 whether a piece of paper or textile, a sculptural surface, wall or screen.\r\n\r\nMartin is a designer, curator, cultural facilitator, choreographer, performer, teacher, and more. She has collaborated with iconic brands such as Vitra, Max Mara, Tiffany & Co, and B&B Italia, and in 2021 The North Face launched a Shantell Martin collection featuring her drawings inspired by pieces from their Search & Rescue archive. She has also collaborated with legendary artists such as Pulitzer Prize-winning performance artist Kendrick Lamar and acclaimed designer Kelly Wearstler. \r\n\r\nFrom design, fashion, and celebrity collaborations to positions at MIT Media Lab, NYU, Columbia University\u2019s Brown Institute, and choreographing a ballet at the Boston Ballet, Martin\u2019s drawn LINE constantly evolves. Creating new connections, she explores themes such as intersectionality, identity, and play. \r\n\r\nIn addition to solo shows at renowned art institutions including the 92Y Gallery in New York City, the iconic Albright Knox Gallery, and the New Britain Museum of American Art, Martin has carved a path for herself as a producer and visual artist. At the Brown Institute for Media Innovation, she created a large-scale wall installation and worked with the Institute\u2019s research group to explore how visual and computerized storytelling might influence media and technology innovation.",

Seats are offered on a first come, first served basis; please arrive early to secure a spot. Please contact kimjulie@umich.edu with any questions or accommodation needs.\r\n\r\n\"In Spanish, you do not 'pay attention,' you 'lend attention.' I use this idea as a subtle technique in character development that often draws details from the people and places I know best. These details are what I call \u201cthe understory\u201d of memory. The way authors do this is not accidental, it is a form of intuitive writing. There is always more than meets the eye.\"\r\n\r\nLuis Alberto Urrea, a Guggenheim Fellow and Pulitzer Prize finalist, is the author of 18 books, winning numerous awards for his poetry, fiction and essays. Born in Tijuana to a Mexican father and American mother, Urrea is most recognized as a border writer, though he says, \u201cI am more interested in bridges, not borders.\u201d His most recent novel, *Good Night Irene*, was published in May 2023 and is inspired by his mother\u2019s service in Europe during WWII as a Red Cross Clubmobile \u201cDonut Dolly.\u201d\r\n\r\n*The Devil\u2019s Highway,* Urrea\u2019s 2004 non-fiction account of a group of Mexican immigrants lost in the Arizona desert, won the Lannan Literary Award and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the Pacific Rim Kiriyama Prize. *The House of Broken Angels,* was a 2018 finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and a *New York Times* Notable Book of the Year. He won an American Academy of Arts and Letters Fiction award for his collection of short stories, *The Water Museum,* which was a finalist for the PEN\/Faulkner Award. Urrea\u2019s novel *Into the Beautiful North* is a Big Read selection of the National Endowment of the Arts.

Zoom registration at https:\/\/myumi.ch\/W281w\r\n\r\nNor Ismah introduces a novel approach to examining fatwas (Islamic legal opinions) within the context of Indonesia, with the aim of contributing to the broader field of Islamic Studies on fatwa-making. It advocates for a redirection of research attention towards women's fatwa-making, emphasizing their lived experiences and the specific locales where they issue fatwas. By integrating Islamic studies frameworks with anthropological research and gender studies, my presentation challenges the conventional concentration on male-dominated institutions, highlighting the grassroots level practice of issuing fatwas, particularly by women.\r\n   \r\n   She contends that fatwa-issuing institutions exhibit gendered structures that marginalize women from significant roles and recognition as Islamic scholars. Consequently, an exploration of women's fatwa-making necessitates an examination of various interaction sites between female muftis and those seeking fatwas. These interactions unveil dynamic shifts in women's experiences, religious authority, and everyday fatwa-making practices influenced by context-specific resources. The active participation of women disrupts traditional norms, challenging gendered structures within fatwa-making institutions.\r\n   \r\n   Additionally, it signifies the evolution of doctrinal changes and ethical practices, transforming fatwas from static outcomes into a dynamic and inclusive realm of interaction, innovation, and Islamic authority. The presentation argues that the success observed in Indonesia holds paramount importance for a comprehensive understanding of Muslim women's experiences in contemporary Muslim society. To achieve a holistic perspective, the study recommends shifting the focus away from the Middle East and expanding research to encompass Muslims in other regions, particularly Southeast Asia, where the most populous Muslim country is situated. This shift is envisioned to offer a well-rounded depiction of the diverse experiences of Muslim women beyond the conventional geographical center of Islam.\r\n   \r\n   Nor Ismah is Deputy Director of the Institute of Southeast Asian Islam at Sunan Kalijaga State Islamic University in Indonesia. She holds a Master\u2019s degree in Southeast Asian Studies from the School of Pacific and Asian Studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, completing her studies in 2012 with the support of the Ford Foundation International Fellowship Program. From 2016 to 2023, she pursued her PhD studies at the Leiden University Institute for Area Studies (LIAS), sponsored by the Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education under the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia. Nor Ismah\u2019s research focuses on Islam, women's knowledge production, and media. In recognition of her scholarly achievements, Nor Ismah was awarded the Co2libri Early Career Researcher Fellowship at the Institute of Asian and African Studies, Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin in 2023. She received the prestigious 2023-2024 Association of Asian Studies Gosling-Lim Postdoctoral Fellowship in Southeast Asian Studies, which is hosted by and has brought her to the Center for Southeast Asian Studies (CSEAS) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\r\n\r\nIf there is anything we can do to make this event accessible to you, please contact us at cseas@umich.edu.

        "description":"Abstract:  Turbulent particle-laden flows give rise to spatial heterogeneity (e.g. clustering) characterized by two-point statistics.  Most coarse-grained (i.e. two fluid) models only solve for one-point moments, limiting reproduction of important two-phase flow statistics.  In this talk, we present set of equations describing the evolution of these flows that include fluctuating components of filtered fields --- a description of the level of clustering present in these flows.  For dilute heavy particles settling in homogeneous isotropic turbulence, the averaged filtered drag and filtered Reynolds-stress like term that dictates enhanced settling is correlated to this description of volume fraction fluctuation.  A data-driven approach that efficiently traverses parameter space in direct numerical simulations to inform closures is proposed, providing both descriptive insights and directions for future modeling.  Further, a numerical crossflow experiment is proposed, yielding several advantages over traditional forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence for the study of turbulent particle-laden flows.  The filtered volume fraction is shown to be valuable in that it may enable better fits for unclosed quantities related to particle drag and particle-phase momentum flux in coarse-grained simulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact:  Silas Alben",

Ten concepts are shared which all illuminate personal attributes often forgotten as we study music. All of the ten were realized through my own mistakes and shortcomings. My wish is to transparently share these with people who have doubt as to how they should proceed in this wonderful, daunting life as a musician. It is real world advice; no nonsense advice; get real advice. Examining your own motives, developing key relationships and embracing change are discussed. *International Musician*, *Modern Drummer* and *Muso* Magazine have published excerpts from its contents.\n\nTalk followed by a Q&A\n\nGUEST BIO\n\nJOHN WITTMANN is Associate Vice President of Artist Relations for the Yamaha Artist Relations Group. He is responsible for organizing educational programs and support for Yamaha Artists both nationally and internationally. Holding two degrees in music, John was a band director in New York State where he headed two highly successful High School music programs. John has toured extensively and has given hundreds of drum set clinics. He is an active performer, clinician and lecturer and has been published in many magazines. John is a strong music advocate and a frequent presenter at NAMM, PASIC, and other major music conferences.",

        "description":"\"As temperature records are broken across the world, the melting of glaciers and ice sheets is accelerating. Rising surface temperatures likewise guarantee new conditions of drought and flood, exacerbated by a slowing jet stream that will tend to stall weather systems in unpredictable ways. Our changing cryospheres and hydrospheres promise misery to millions across the planet. But they also reveal forms of material connectivity that could potentially be mobilized in the struggle against climate change and the petroculture that produced it. In this presentation, we juxtapose Cymene Howe\u2019s elemental ethnography of the transformation of ice into water in the Arctic with Dominic Boyer\u2019s research on how Houstonians are seeking to adapt to the increasing presence of stormwater in their lives. We discuss a concept we call \u201chydrological globalization\u201d to highlight the elemental connections and cultural impacts that follow from the redistribution of water across the planet. We also highlight how hydrological precarity creates new possibilities for alliances across the world built out of shared Anthropocene experiences like droughts, fires and flooding.\"\r\n\r\nDominic Boyer is an anthropologist, media maker and environmental researcher who teaches at Rice University where he served as Founding Director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Research in the Human Sciences (2013-2019). He recently published Energopolitics (Duke UP, 2019), which analyzes the politics of wind power development in Southern Mexico and Hyposubjects (Open Humanities Press, 2021), an experimental collaboration with Timothy Morton concerning politics in the Anthropocene. With Cymene Howe, he made a documentary film about Iceland\u2019s first major glacier (Okj\u00f6kull) lost to climate change, Not Ok: a little movie about a small glacier at the end of the world (2018). In August 2019, together with Icelandic collaborators they installed a memorial to Okj\u00f6kull\u2019s passing, an event that attracted media attention from around the world and which caused The Economist to create their first-ever obituary for a non-human. During 2021-22 he held an artist residency at The Factory in Dj\u00fapav\u00edk, Iceland, and was a Berggruen Institute Fellow in Los Angeles working on a project on \u201cElectric Futures.\u201d His most recent book is titled No More Fossils (U Minnesota Press, 2023) a discussion of fossil fuel fossils and what is to be done about them.\r\n\r\nCymene Howe is Professor of Anthropology and Founding Co-Director of the Science and Technology Studies Program at Rice University. Her books include Intimate Activism (Duke 2013) and Ecologics: Wind and Power in the Anthropocene (Duke 2019), and the co-edited collections Anthropocene Unseen (Punctum 2020), Solarities: Elemental Encounters and Refractions (Punctum 2023), and The Johns Hopkins Guide to Critical and Cultural Theory. Her research has been funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Fulbright Commission, and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and she was awarded The Berlin Prize for transatlantic dialogue in the arts, humanities, and public policy. Her current research examines the changing dynamics between people and bodies of ice in the Arctic region and sea level adaptation in coastal cities around the world. Out of her research in the Arctic region, she co-created documentary film Not Ok: A Little Movie about a Small Glacier at the End of the World (2019) and the memorial for Okj\u00f6kull, the world\u2019s first funeral for a glacier fallen to climate change.",
